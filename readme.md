songs and poems for use with fortune.

Makes a nice screensaver with xscreensaver hacks like phosphor.

Hacks working well with those: `fliptext`, `starwars`, `fontglide`, `phosphor`.

Hacks working well, but requiring transliteration: `splitflap`, `apple2`

Example of usage for apple2 with transliteration: `apple2 -program 'fortune fortunes | iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//translit'`
